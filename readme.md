This is the final project I developed for my web mapping class
with Dr. Jonathan Sugg. This map is meant to depict the current and
proposed wind turbine energy site across the United States.
One of the short comings of this map is the lack of color coding.
I had a difficult time find out how to change the color of a
marker based on a feature property. That being said, I was able to
make the markers popup different tool tips based on such a feature.
Another thing I would have liked to do was add more information to
the popups. Ideally, the titles, owner fo the site, and MW capacity
would all be displayed along side the status.
